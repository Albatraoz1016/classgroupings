This file is not used by the program at all. It is a place for you to add file pathnames to various files you
create, so you don't have to go finding them every time. I put some examples - they're not associated with real
files. There is no rule to how you document things here, and there are no rules on how you name the files that
contain the roll list. so long as the filelocation.txt file has one correct path to the file you want to use in it,
then it will work.
